# Sample Review

# All Possible Sample Slides

## Sample Error

__Sample Error:__ $\alpha(s) - \alpha(p)$

  - The error depends on the sample and the attribute

Quantifying Error:

  - For numerical attributes, this is determined mathematically
  - For graphical attributes it is not precise and meant to be taken notionally

## Taking a sample

```{r}
s = sample(length(agpop$farms87), 100)
```

## Fisher Consistency

### Definition

If the sample S is equal to the population P, then the sample error should be zero (or non-existent)

  - This would mean that the estimation is in some sense consistent


## Sample as a Population

In every respect S (the sample) could be considered a population itself and might even sensibly be called a "sample population"

  - Treating S as a population allows us to evaluate any population attribute on the sample in the same way wee would for P
  - In some applications, we use the term "pseudo population" in reference to the sample

Some samples will have a small sample error, and some will have a large one

### All possible samples

- Suppose the population has size N and we want samples of size n.
  - Then there are ${N \choose n}$ different possible samples of size n

```{r}
# Code for N choose n
combn(N, n)
```

## Average Sample Error

The average sample error over all possible samples of size n is:

$$Average sample error = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_s}\alpha(S_i)}{N_s}-\alpha(P)$$

## Consistency

The concentration indicates some kind of consistency for the particular attribute here

  - To quantify this concentration we could do:

$$|\alpha(S) - \alpha(P)| < c$$ 

  - for some c > 0

Consider a population P of size $N < \infinity$

  - for each n, we can construct the set of all possible samples
  $$P_S(n) = {S : S \subset P and |S| = n}$$
  - for any c > 0 
  $$P_a(c,n) = {S : S \subset P_S(n) and |a(S) - a(P)| <c}$$
  - and define the proportion
  $$p_a(c,n) = \frac{P_a(c,n)}{P_S(n)}$$
  - for all c > 0, and $n \leq N$

If we plot the absolute sample error vs the proportion for varying sample size n, for a fixed c > 0 we see that the proportion increases with n

## Comparing Attributes

To compare different attributes, we use the __relative__ absolute sample error.
For any c > 0 let,

$$P_a^{\*}(c,n) = {s : S \subset P_S(n) and \frac{|a(S) - a(P)}{\alpha(P)} <c}$$

and define the corresponding proportion, for all c > 0, and $n \leq N$

$$p_a^{\*}(c,n) = \frac{P_a^{*}(c,n)}{P_S(n)}$$

which measures the consistency of the sample attribute with respect to the same population attribute

# Selecting Samples

As the sample size increases,

- sample attribute values concentrate about the population attribute (at least, we hope that happens)
- This concentration reassures us that estimating the population attribute from a sample attribute may not be too misleading

For any particular sample, there is little to suggest whether it is good or bad in itself

## Selecting Samples

For any particular sample

  - The attribute calculated based on the sample identical to the population attribute or
  - it might be so different we would be completely misled about the true nature of the population attribute from the sample attribute

This is why it is important to understand how the sample is selected, and if it is within our power to do so, to have a hand in selecting the sample itself.

  - Even when the latter is possible, enormous care must be taken so that our own prejudices and pre-conceptions about the population do not render a sample that is misleading.

## Population of Samples

Consider the population of M samples with size n.

$$P_S = {S_1, S_2, ..., S_M}$$

Any attribute is not just a variate on that unit!

$$P_a(S) = {a(S_2), a(S_2), ..., a(S_M)}$$

If we select our sample from $P_S$ with probability $\frac{1}{M}$ then the histogram shows the distribution for the variate values $\alpha(S)$
