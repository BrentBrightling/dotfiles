# Comparison Over Multiple Samples

- APSE over multiple samples

When we are studying APSE we want to study over multiple samples

$\hat{\mu}$ is a value that depends on the sample, so it can take on the good or bad of a sample.
Thus APSE also depends on the sample as it depends on $\hat{\mu}$

If we want the APSE of all samples, we need to calculate the APSE for every sample, and then calculate the average of them.

## Notation

Assume that $\mu(x)$ is the conditional average  of y __given__ x.

$E(Y_i|x) = E(\alpha + \beta x_i + R_i)$

$= \alpha + \beta x_i + E(R_i)$ where $E(R_i)=0$

Note: It has to be $E(Y_i|x)$ as it is given the height, or else we would have a random variable equal to a contant one.

Note that in the lobolly trees we have multiple points all at one X, and for the temperature we have a data point at every value at X. 
This will effect how APSE functions on our data

$Var(\tilde{\mu})$ is the variance of the different estimators used

We know that $P = S \union T$ so $\sum_{i \in P} = \sum_{i \in S} + \sum_{i \in T}$

The average variance is 0 when we only have one data point for x, however, if we have multiple points then this will have a value

As the complexity of the model increases the variability of $\tilde{\mu}$ increases

### Bias

$Bias = E(\tilde{\theta}- \theta)$$

When we are calculating bias our "true" value would be the piecewise function.
Not the model that we created.

### Variance $\tilde{\mu_{s}(x)}
