            Your Occasions is owned and operated by Ray Ireland. Ray started decorating over 20 years ago for small wedding receptions and ceremonies until someone asked for "the works" and from that day on, Your Occasions came to be. Hundreds of weddings later Ray, his wife Rose and their team of decorators continue to work closely with clients to create the wedding they imagined. Every client is important, no matter the size of your budget or the location of your event. We love what we do and it shows in the repeat business and referrals we receive.
